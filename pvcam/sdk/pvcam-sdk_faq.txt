PVCAM SDK
---------

Q1: How can I obtain the SDK package?
A1: SDK package is available upon request to all application developers. It
   includes code samples and the files necessary to dynamically link to PVCAM.

Q2: How can I install the SDK package?
A2: On Ubuntu, it is recommended to use an interactive helper script that
   installs all dependencies.
   Run the helper script with normal user rights:
    $ bash pvcam-sdk__install_helper-Ubuntu.sh

   Otherwise, just run the installer directly with normal user rights
   (N.N.N.N is the version number):
    $ bash pvcam-sdk_N.N.N.N-N.run

   The installer will temporarily extract the data into current folder and run
   internally an installation script using sudo command, which will ask for user
   password.
   Be sure the user is allowed to use sudo.

Q3: What packages are included with PVCAM SDK installer?
A3: Public header files, documentation, helper libraries, examples and a few
   other files come with the PVCAM SDK installer.
   They help to understand how PVCAM works and allow to build PVCAM-based
   applications.

Q4: What packages PVCAM SDK depends on?
A4: All PVCAM installers will suggest a list of packages that should be
   installed. Basically, the SDK does not depend on any package.
   Other dependencies depend on application used or are required for developers
   only.
   More detailed list is in pvcam-sdk_required_packages-Ubuntu.txt file.

Q5: What applications are provided? What are their locations and what is the
   purpose of each of them?
A5: The SDK comes with a number of examples, from simple C tests to complex GUI
   application. For instance, start with a set of example command line
   applications, and have a look into /opt/pvcam/sdk/examples/code_samples
   folder.

Q6: How to rebuild code samples?
A6: First, copy the chosen project folder from /opt to any folder with write
   permissions, e.g. in your home.
   Ensure the new path does *not* contain whitespaces!
    $ mkdir ~/build
    $ cp -r /opt/pvcam/sdk/examples/code_samples/ ~/build

   Second, switch to folder with Makefile and build all binaries, e.g.:
    $ cd ~/build/code_samples/src/ImageSequence
    $ make clean && make        <-- cleans and builds debug and release binaries

   Optionally, build only debug or release binaries:
    $ make clean_debug   && make debug      <-- cleans and builds debug only
    $ make clean_release && make release    <-- cleans and builds release only

   Built binaries are then located in bin folder, e.g. on x86_64 platform see:
    $ ls ~/build/code_samples/bin/linux-x86_64/debug
    $ ls ~/build/code_samples/bin/linux-x86_64/release

Q7: What environment variables should I be aware of?
A7: There are a few environment variables provided by PVCAM or SDK. They all
   start with PVCAM_ prefix. See the list with command:
    $ env | grep PVCAM_

   SDK currently defines one environment variable only.

   PVCAM_SDK_PATH - Defines path into sdk folder that can be used by developers
        to easily configure projects (if not using pkg-config).
